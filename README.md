## Entities

All sensors will be grouped under a device named after your vehicle (e.g., `Ford Focus`).

Entity IDs are now short and clean, for example: `sensor.estimated_range` or `sensor.last_refuel_cost`.

## Troubleshooting

-   **Integration not found:** Check the logs under **Settings > System > Logs** for errors.
-   **Sensors unavailable:** Ensure your API credentials are correct and that Home Assistant has an active internet connection.
